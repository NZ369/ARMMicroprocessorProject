# ARM Microprocessor Project
Employing Convergence Computing Algorithm in calculating the 16th root on an ARM 32-bit architecture machine.

This project is focused on calculating the 16th root of a number using Convergence Computing Method (CCM) and fixed point arithmetic. The CCM algorithm performs a series of additions that eventually converge on the correct answer. This algorithm will be discussed in-depth in section 2.0.  Our report will be organized as follows: after explaining the algorithm, we will present our design. There are a few parts to the design, the first being our initial unoptimized solution, and the second part being the final product with optimizations implemented. The accuracy and performance of these two iterations will be compared and the results will be shown. In addition to the optimizations we implemented, there will be an estimation of the potential performance enhancements that would result from a hardware unit encapsulating a portion of the code being introduced.

After the design section, there will be a brief discussion on our results, as well as future enhancements and fixes that could be implemented. Finally, we will present our conclusion.  The processor we are using is the ARM machine available via the UVic Engineering lab, and the VM provided for this course. This processor has 32-bit architecture, but still supports 64-bit arithmetic.
